# ATP Data Modeling

A brief introduction to Data Analysis and Machine Learning algorithms such as Linear Regression.

## Description

The code is structured in commented blocks of code. When un-commented, each block visualizes the relationship between a feature and an outcome with a Train and Test score. These scores are numerical values representing how strong the relationship is between the two variables.

## Example - Breaking Points Opportunities vs Winnings

```sh   
Train score: 0.82
Test score: 0.77
   ```
- High scores, strong relationship.

The scale of the score is 0-1.
- 0: No relationship at all.
- 1: Perfect relationship.
