# ATP Data Modeling

This short project was an excuse to learn about data visualisation and Machine Learning using Linear Regression in Python using matplotlib, pandas and sk-learn.
## Description

The code is structured in commented blocks of code. When un-commented, each block visualizes the relationship between a feature and an outcome with a Train and Test score. These scores are numerical values representing how strong the relationship is between the two variables.

## Example - Breaking Points Opportunities vs Winnings
- High scores, strong relationship.
```sh   
#Train score: 0.82
#Test score: 0.77
   ```
## Example - Return Games Won vs Winnings
- Low scores, weak relationship.
```sh   
#Train score: 0.07
#Test score: 0.09
```

### Tip
The scale of the score is 0-1.
- 0: No relationship at all.
- 1: Perfect relationship.

#### Note
- I do not own the data used in the code.
